}

return message-
{
    "message": "User registered",

}

Note: role can be "Admin", "SuperAdmin". The standard itself for user is Student so it you want to send student in the role 
for a student registering that shouldn't matter. When the role "Admin" or "SuperAdmin" it will populate the user table like normal
but it will also add to the Admin or SuperAdmin Table respectively.
